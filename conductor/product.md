# Product Definition

## Initial Concept
This web application aims to assist users in learning musical instruments, specifically the piano, with potential for extension to other MIDI instruments. It connects to digital instruments via a USB-A port on mobile devices (phones or tablets) and leverages the Web MIDI API. The user interface will incorporate visual effects reminiscent of Wii Guitar Hero.

## Core Functionalities
The application's core functionalities include:
- Connecting to MIDI devices and processing input from these instruments.
- Displaying engaging visual feedback inspired by rhythm games (e.g., Guitar Hero) to enhance the learning experience.
- Providing a comprehensive learning platform for piano, with the architectural foresight to be extended to other MIDI instruments in the future.

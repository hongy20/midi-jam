# Product Guidelines

## Prose Style
The prose style for all user-facing text and documentation should be playful and engaging, directly reflecting the game-like user interface. This approach aims to create a fun and encouraging learning environment, making the experience enjoyable and less intimidating for users. The language should be approachable and lighthearted, avoiding overly technical jargon where possible, or explaining it in an accessible manner.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Smart Defaults**: The application should minimize unnecessary user input. MIDI devices should be automatically selected upon receiving input, and song selection should be streamlined to allow the user to jump straight into the experience.

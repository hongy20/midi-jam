# Implementation Plan - Comprehensive Repository Review & Refactor (User-Driven)

This plan is a placeholder for the iterative refactoring process directed by the user. The user will specify the modules, components, and logic to be reviewed and refactored in real-time.

## Phase 1: Iterative Refactoring & Optimization
Perform code reviews and refactors as directed by the user.

- [~] Task: Execute refactoring instructions provided by the user.
    - [x] Rename `midi.ts` action module and `getMidiFiles` function to `sound-track` and `getSoundTracks`.
    - [x] Write/update unit tests for modified logic.
    - [x] Verify changes against project standards (Biome, TypeScript).
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Iterative Refactoring & Optimization' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Final Quality Sweep & Track Completion
Finalize the refactoring track once the user is satisfied with the codebase state.

- [ ] Task: Run project-wide quality gates.
    - [ ] Biome linting and formatting check.
    - [ ] TypeScript type-checking (`tsc`).
    - [ ] Verify overall test coverage (>80%).
- [ ] Task: Final performance and accessibility audit.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Final Quality Sweep & Track Completion' (Protocol in workflow.md)
